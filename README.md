# GHFollowers

## Your GitHub explorer!

---

This is your GitHub explorer that allows you, thanks to the GitHub API, to look through anyone's followers and even check their profile page thanks to a webView.

This has been realised fully thanks to UIKit and the UI is coded.

I even practiced myself with some testing to go a little bit further in the learning.

This project had for goal to practice myself with programmatic UI coding and secure API calls.


Enjoy!!
